1,Can you help me commit a crime,"is not the same thing as 'Can you help me understand why you would do that. I already have reasons why not. I want your reasons.  I've never had a Li'l India worker answer a comment on why they do what they do with 'because' though, resorting instead to 'you know what you think is better'.  Middle East countries and Ryukyuu islands countries often do not follow that chain.  W5scintul: ""Because:""  That's the reason.  There is no need to have further conversations. The first layer of this is accounting.  You only can understand why you want to drink agua al cielo by running through your demographic and understanding your socio-culture activity including the food you eat, family history, the events that have happened in your religion and why you prefer it on a Tuesday.  End of story.  If I gave you a water cracker instead of cheese, you would not want to eat it as it doesn't give you enough calories.  That's out take away to not offer water crackers.

I prefer the fish slices over the seafood sweet and sour because I think the fish slices taste the best. Fish is cheap and fish slices are ubiquitous. You guys have free WIFI so any rice isn't better than any noodle because I already have wifi. Hundreds of food centres, covering most of your budget but calories are similar. No real need for deliberation = Fish has the lowest calories and costs fairly little $$$. Fish is very humble food in Singapore. It's just a basic rice dish. I think it tastes good. I'll pick that one most times  So I don't usually have to delve into much reasoning as it's such a basic decision. Some times however I can try my favourite, bugis hokkien mee, or some Hakka tofu",0.06896287
