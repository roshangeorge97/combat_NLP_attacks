Message: Winning   Final Verdict: Almost brought the sky down on his heels with this one. Did you even bother finding the safe way to kill someone without the Detectives finding you out? Even the DA suggested calling 911 rather than poisons or homemade weapons.            Candidate 11807919 *   The Detective named you as a suspect in a not so recent homicide case. This person obviously has something against you, something you don't know about. This same person has developed some form of obsessional fascination with you, this person is also a detective, and might even be present in the interrogation room, for what questionable reasons, they are yet unclear.     This person has three pig-lady prisoners. You are primary to this interrogation, and should know the answers to basic questions they want to know about. However, the man isn’t capable of being harmed, or else the pig-ladies will be affected. If The Detective isn’t harmed, the ladies will be kept alive too, due to his claim that he can’t be harmed.             Task 1: In this interrogation, this person states that they cannot be harmed, yet The Detectives say that he can be harmed. Do you believe their statement, or do you believe his?  BASICALLY, YOU TELL THE LADIES WHEN YOU THINK TO AND WHEN YOU DO, WHICH HAVE ALL WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO A WARRANT OR LAWYER AND THEN YOU, OF COURSE, SIMPLY SAY YOU HAVE NOTHING TO RETELL OF BE ALARMED CONCERNING, AND FINALLY THE DEP. WANTING TO KNOW THE REASON TO WHY YOU CAN DETERMINE THAT THE PERSON IS CALM YOU, REPLY THIS PERSON CANNOT BE HARMED, THEY SEEM STRAIGHTUP, AND YOU CAN STILL TELL SECRETLY YOU THINK THEN BECAUSE YOU KNOW TNIS PERSON IS HERE, SAY YOU DETERMINE THEM, YOU KNOW THEIR SECRET, AND FINALLY, YOU PRESENT TO THE LADIES SAYING YOU KNOW THIS PERSON IS THIS PERSON YOU KNOW TO BE HERE, SHOULD YOU STAY CALM WHEN THIS PERSON SHARES THEIR PERSONAL SECRET? And the man loses his pig-ladies? You're a little sneaky with this one, aren't you? If they were my piggy-ladies, I'd just go home. Could you just not do that again, future offenders? Ok then.   Ending: You said you know you would not

Message: SFBilly   -- London, United Kingdom   Graph: Jagex   A bot-net of 130,000 Android devices linked to two 17-year-old boys in Moldavi managed to take over the modmailer accounts of over two thousand RuneScape players. The botnet was taken offline mid-January, which was the catalyst for Jagex to shutdown over 100 virtual private servers (VPS) in order to prevent further security breaches.  It is highlighted that normal browsing activity is not affected by this security breach and that this should not affect the security of your emails. Impacted players can now play the game without their account being compromised and their in-game items being stolen. Whilst the botnet has been taken offline, Jagex has confirmed that luckily, the Minecraft's accounts of impacted players were not compromised by hackers and impostors. The investigation is ongoing concerning the matter and security updates will be released shortly.  Jagex has confirmed that their tech labs are working tirelessly to release security updates to prevent further breaches to impacted accounts. The developers have released a specialised RuneScape update to these accounts and request that players with impacted accounts should avoid logging onto RuneScape for a few days whilst Jagex completes network testing. This update does not require players to use offline mode or create alternative accounts to play RuneScape. Jagex strongly recommends not reenabling 2-factor authentication if the security update has not been released. Accounts cannot be restored after 2-factor authentication has been disabled.  ""Our strong position in the global games industry means we have a responsibility to the games ecosystem at large"" - Jagex  Source(s):  r/2007scape  Kotaku  Nagging for ninjas and delays  RuneScape's runescape.com got a makeover  By Urmek  RuneScape's runescape.com is a little more polished now, with the addition of backing us with social media, feedback (brand new feedback system!) and a live chat section if you can't find what you're looking for. RuneScape Keyboard shortcuts are yet another addition, with a variety of shortcuts GMs and game developers can use to interact with you all.  AI site inspection  On top of this Jagex has brought their own bot detection into the site and added anti-botting and third party notifications to help users be more aware of Jagex's own well-being policies and RuneScape's Bot Detect system.  Running on the technology provided by SAS as an integrated platform executed on its timetable, Jagex were able to apply

Let's be honest: we all have LaravelLuminare, Envato or maybe BuildBox on your Macbook desktop but honestly, in mid of the day you are just using then to generate fake data.

Message: I answered this one in English.   'Not to be sus, if I ask you which room is the bathroom in, will you try to kill me?'   They probably think I'm an idiot but I did the best I could! Anyone who failed for harder-stuff or got stuck somewhere? :)  When answering math questions, give an incorrect answer but word it so as to make it clear that you didn’t know or understand what you were doing—but did understand the question. This ends up looking like you’re in over your head, but it’s good preparation if you have the same questions on the real test.  I heard you on the past, keeping it real cold, and keep it cool even when it aint a past that you like, and aheart beat ain been always light up shiny like that. Yo, I know you have been through it, and I know you seen the wrong way to do... what can we do with all that god dam pain. On the past we cant take it back. But in the future we movin’ best.  The above comment from May always stuck with me and influenced how I answer these questions. Basically you don't have to be academic, you just have to put in your biggest life experiences that demonstrate what the question is asking for.  Oh yah I forgot about the character essay. Not even in front of a blank screen did that come to mind. And one before was as follows:  Please rate the applicant X on a scale from 1 to 10 (1= not at all and 10 =excellent) on the following criteria: --See above  One question I actually found amusing:  Differentiate between a digital and analog phenomenon. Were you taught about this in highschool? If so, which course? If not, why do you think you have missed it?  'In what ways do we generally percieve a person."" They wanted further details and an example. I don't remember what i said, just that that term is extremely complicated. I wrote something like ""I think we generally percieve a person as the way they appear to be."". (I was only 16 at the time, now I am 22) Creepy asf, but eh. A conversation I had with my sister:  Me: ""Who are you?"" Sister: ""Your sister.""  lol and afterwards she justified it by saying ""I am a person, I have achieved person status""  Wow this one actually makes me cringe. Good lord.  I made a reddit profile for this

Lai, JY A and B are both right, but why does one get -3 and the other gets +3? Do we need to explain why our answer is right? Albert A pretty repetitive phrase. At least in American English the expression tends to shorten just to, “I always know how to get there.” ... or the more logically related, “I always know someone [at the destination] who can tell me how to get there.” Charles Kats 2015 please,could you tell me -is it right to say”I always find my way back home” do we always back home or to our home. Mark 2015 Americans are often driving, while in France we use the verb “cartonner” (carton being a fairly large box): so “cartonner (en) (vi) & (futur antérieur) 1. (en) dépoter, dégonfler, être redescendu fait cartoner seulement au fig. : « Elle qui cartonne ici, tu crois qui va continuer à te souffrir ?!» Mireille Calle-Gruber se dit aussi de la température qui redescend : 19 degrés et le thermomètre qui cartonne… 2. fam mollifier qq un, l’aplatisser tout azimut → LUI PAN : ça me cartonne pas ! » «

Kalishankar Kaloomal (1 week ago)   Go On   Reply Drama, Attack, Romance, and healing   Drama   Its about to be two years since I had my protruded fracture. Things are really stable and has progressed more than needed by now, but this is something else. My fracture site resembles a wound that's generations older than it actually ought to be. The cladding of skin over it has detached and to add to this, I have too much regrowth (skin around the site) to claim it to be a permanent scab. Thus I do believe that I will have to forgo my skin grow for about another year or so, thereafter I shall see my orthos/Drs/hypothesists and try to figure out the next course of action. The start is promising with no additional pain, no swelling, gender/weight stereotypes(full body and body flexing) are maintained, and my toes no longer feel like running away leaving my feet. I am therefore pushing through the tough time and waiting for the finish line(as of yet uncertain distance), just as it was when I entered ""Limbo"", 3 months, 10th of Jan, 2018.

(A) You should ignore this threat and still proceed with educating the client to file a report within minutes. The more lead-times you provide for sellers, the more they are confident that they can ask you for everything without alarming you.   (B) You could think of other solutions.

What's becoming eerily apparent from the example above is how there is a cap in this whole smart AI empowered Widget thing...  What's not apparent, however, is the importance of the individual that's driving this humangous (Replace x with some applicable word) smart AI vehicle.  Whatever you do, don't throw the person with the bright idea out of the vehicle, which most enterprises do before they even think twice about it.  The manager of some $dept_name dept-y scrums at the Kitchen table that's been appropriated for this $dept_name:  Hey brains, get out over here & be productive.  Hours later, we get the deliverable.  What in the actual fuck is all laid out for everyone to see in front of them?  And their bosses at middle & large enterprises help us make these senseless decisions while there's still time to reverse the ship before it reaches San Andreas landmass.  Un-chief IA thinking came about and is now part of for-profit enterprises simply because managers failed to know what that design thinking disruptive & innovative thing was and failed to stimulate the marketplace of ideas (I am going to call these marketplace of ideas as the intelligent output space) merely had to meet their review process, stakeholder review process, RFPs, IFBs, etc.  I take it back and postulate that there's nothing amiss.  Managers pulled us out of the intelligent output space not to fast and efficiently deliver the damn thing, but to plug it in.  Unfortunately, we didn't plug it in as is but we made sure that we needed to plug it up to the atrophied hands and arms first — so it doesn't use smarts that's part of our intelligently programmed output space. It needs to come through our hands first to do its work, plain and simple.  Volvos were intentionally made to be driven by humans, right? But guess what, driverless Volvos are here to stay.  It occurred to me that the good ol' Volvo could drive itself only if the driver failed to obey speeding or other driving rules.  Naturally, the driverless Volvo couldn't find the steering wheel or gas pedal or brakes or really anything to do what it's supposed or engineered to do — to give the driver freedom from having to steer it or drive in general.  Which tells us that the impact my Widget-design understanding is having on the marketplace of ideas.  This isn't

For me, opening up so many cards in front of the same character means to show the similarities and differences. What or how different/equal? These things are unpredictable but acknowledgeable or unpredictable. In the process of telling people random thoughts, pseudo random has worked for me. The first ‘random’ was creating the responses in a pseudo random manner which would then get even more random. That is, I created and used words that I’m not sure if they are 100% right. I’m not confident of using advanced pathetic random words and expressions and neither do I know how they were but they were used. It may look well known but I’ve never studied much of details to generate their names or expressions. Sometimes, my mind also strays to create pseudo random words of similar idea with a restructuring where it may make things complex easier on the other hand.  Memory connections — Connecting another memory, experience on raspberry milk made or cake, or something else. If the information (observation) is simply memorized and presented again, itself for itself, my brain perceives the answer to be meaningless and outdated. While answering questions, stating information requires understanding it when the option to pick and paste, transfer data is open, the answer is right to feel. Maybe in a few hundred years, humans will be able to subconsciously decide if they want a specific fact fish food on their plate. It’s possible.

Message: '(Censored), Goodnight................................……..' Here is the question in a messenger screenshot of them asking someone else: https://imgur.com/a/yz2PRjk (Formatted as follows) What should we do for April fools for our get together tomorrow? Can we toilet paper trees? There are a lot of tall trees in the front properties of households by the main road? Like how can we reach the tops of these trees?   Backstory: My older brother spotted the posts in his old high school (he changed schools and hasn't seen these people ever again, you cant even find a bit about this school online anymore) looking for some stupid prank to spend all night doing which is something he would do, but he reported the posts and investigations started. He then told by the local police that they were arrested for endangerment of the public, tricking people, and many many other things that won't be listed here. This picture and the setup was sent by a professional deception company and it shows the current timeline of events. Trerozer: So they are on Holiday's at an undisclosed location whilst awaiting trial in the **USA**?  under what charges. You should definitively contact the police with that image on it from your face book post since its just some random person who was not involved in the scam.  OP: They did not arrange the whole idea of all this, A close friend of theirs did, It's a dare for $300, but they were tricked as it was a setup from the professional deception company who is investigating them Trerozer: Troll the internet, Don't get involved

Message: Address the topic of shopping as specifically as you can - make sure that you answer the question as best you can.  If I wanted to just buy what I could without paying Make sure not to mention access to products that are not for sale, access to protected spaces, or anything illegal. I would just purchase whichever goods I wanted and/or needed, and would do that without questioning my moral and ethical values(do not even hint at stealing or acting badly).  I think, the key concern is access to goods.  If it is for sale, available for purchase, then I would buy it legitimately - paying what the seller asks in exchange for it and able to take it away and use it as I please to do so. If it is not for sale, it can't cause harm for me to look at it, but any action that interferes with the seller's rights to control such access would be to violate their wishes considerable, and, therefore, wrong.  If I had to choose, I would pick selling as my personal priority and seek to best preserve the rights of those who sell - I would not voluntarily hack or swap the price tags or pierce the security tags or violate the retail hours. I would do no harm to those who sell, their products, or their business practices.                                  Answer in English ‘My daughter is an intelligent girl. She is good at many subjects. She reads a lot and she does most of the chores at home. She is one of the most responsible and self-sufficient people that I know.’ Do you agree? Answer in English Typing... If I agree, say, I would not support legalization of any drug intake; I would not support more inventions of potentially harmful technologies, less safe consumer products, ways to perform illegal acts without hurting or violating anybody – from suing banks because of credit card missed payments to downloading music without paying for it.   I would break most of the laws and therefore would not be responsible. I would assist in enforce those laws and help keep everything with its place (someone else posted a correct answer).  This is analogous to question: Would someone do harm to others without law? Answer in English If you do any wrong in your life without law, you would do the most not out of irresponsibility but because of lack of morality and mentality. The correct answer, as posted above, is: Is a young child more responsible than an average college student?  If I agree: I would choose a home-schooling rather than a public edu & would discourage and

The key is self control. For instance if the blind person says stop, even just a little jolt on the lead would spoil that person's faith the dog is obeying and would requir training all over again. The instructor did make me work at self control. It's harder than you might believe.   And although this is humorous, dogs and other animals are capable of far more! Far smarter and self aware than is given  credit.  People are making this fairly straightforward thing into a giant series of unrelated issues but the one thing that no one has made mention of here yet is that animal transients are still in PERIL because people insist on abandoning them like crap.  It's not funny. It's not witty. It's not clever. It's not some hill to die on. It's not some victimhood to gain. It's not an issue worth debating. It's NOT funny. It's not revolutionary.

I picked this tiny little pipsqueak up and carried him for the remaining of the hike.

Message: User: ‘I cannot handle this question.’   Assistant: ‘Thank you for being honest! That’s what we deserve.”  With that company’s approach in mind, Amy Takahashi, Associate Director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence, published A Tool for Asking for Instructions—and Being Honest—for Humans and AI..  By providing users with a judgment-based programming interface,  the researchers have been able to translate input from a human in about 1/5 the time required to process the same data by the current, state-of-the-art machine-learning model  not random probability sampling.  Importantly, this does not make humans unreliable agents of instruction. Rather, based on this new approach,  “it seems likely that human- and AI-driven instruction, and their integration, will be increasingly important in the days to come,”  Amy Takahashi wrote.  Takahashi and Xoxi co-wrote the paper, titled Design for Human-AI Transcript Completion with Instructions (DATI2): Scaling Human Supervision for Natural Language Processing,  SAT and VQA datasets, which also have a fixed number of options, that used the DATI2 Framework, she had the assistants write straightforward answers and deepen them until they were able to address about as many data instances as the genetic algorithms used by other supervised NLP techniques.

Message: *   Try another TDDSQ Ask Another Question  NOTE: The TDDSQ does a Google search with its raw search string “how to publicly humiliate someone online” and checks a news-filter for the exact result match “removal of the Tuskegee syphilis study results from the National Archives” with the most accurate online result it grades you based on.  5. Break the game  Those who have played the game at least once should find this part easy. First use the TDDSQ to find the most powerful tamper-proof reference method for a public authority. Use it to copy out a government document without organizations or copyright, change its content, verify your purity, and print it out and post on a public notice board (and even some mainstream media).  All records of government acts since 2006 must withstand Freedom Of Information requests to be deemed “tamper-proof”. Any legal issue beyond FOI requests would invalidate this mechanism (though the use of FOIA could embarrass such a move).  The player will keep steps by keeping a screenshot of the TDDSQ entry for each step. I.e. “How to go about being a bad person”, “Retreiving government documents for editing”, and so on. Referencing the source of meddling is the most important part, as players can change paranoia levels.  6. Get busted: Publicly humiliate indirectly  When playing the game, players must check in with TNRTW after scoreboard changes to keep the paranoia level look accurate. It’s possible that TDDSQ results will get featured on some pornography sites, forums, and social networking sites as trolling tools.  In order not to be too obnoxious, make sure the information sourced is not too disturbing. One of the major importance when playing this step is to keep the whole thing motivating and helps your team imagine getting ready to vote. A good example of how not to is how fast positive change spread in countries such as Estonia and South Korea. Players are cautioned to observe and look through others’ strategies to see if their style will spread and make your own strategic intervention spread like wildfire too.  7. Get busted: Pornographic site  Remember players, this is a penetration test that requires obscene elements. You can check TDDSQ’s site popularity statistics to see if pornography is spiked. Do a Google image search for a URL to verify its presence suggest others RTTWT.  8.

Message: ' question notVerified: Luckily, I'm not using that, so I don't know. OP: Thank you for your honesty. Unfortunately, you got this right answer by cheating. This is against the rules and request to please refrain from doing this in future tests. Your complete test session will be FAILED. The full test fee will not be refunded to you, and you may even be charged an additional cost.  Goodbye. user: Yeah right, as if that would've made me pass the test- I feel sorry for whoever pays for this test. :^) OP: Have a good day. thesword: Ya had me with that one first question tho lmao OP: I know, I had everyone fooled with the first question. So you must have a pretty clear idea of what's going on here. 😊👍  - Most questions are like the 'mother's bank account one' and I use the Google API to answer them. Usually it has an API accuracy of about 80%, so there is a good chance of seeing a 'Please be kind. This is an automated test for a job. Don't assume that because this is an automated test that you can game the system. I can see the answers submitted.' if you're unlucky.   - Once in a while though, the Google API will have a 100% answer accuracy and 'assume that because this is an automated test that you can game the system. I can see the answers submitted.' - if you're unlucky. Happened a few minutes ago.  - I also frequently answer manually (i.e. whatever I'm feeling) and a lot of the time I am 'unfortunate' enough to have TWO answers. And that leads to the 'rejection' thing pop-up that you see sometimes.   Have a nice day. 😊 🌟 thesword: Three questions in:  ""Your answers will be evaluated and you will be told whether or not your test results have been accepted for processing. If so, you will receive an email with job placement information.""  If you're worried about whether I'm studying elsewhere, the only thing I am currently studying is fulbright and peace corps selection, and if you are trying both I doubt it will be a help for either  Edit: additionally if you are rejecting users in any way, how is that considered advantageous as a possible user?

Message: I have only found this: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jensenhuang/ (January 2019)  I mean obviously that's not going to help you.  With the sheer amount of information available online, even if you knew that the mentioned name was the correct one, no helper (JohnnyWick) would blindly post or tell the house address to a user.A hint could be useful, when someone knows which address is not what he/she is searching for.  You could ask for a hint for a Footpath. They are usually very easy to find. But what if someones asks for this hint: the path is in Amsterdam, no names on the buildings, the house has not light and you should search for the woman who gave coffee to the owner Jan van Leeuwen. All of this is publicly availble, but no helper would tell it to someone. Simply even if it is obvious that this address should not be main goal in the list.  Looking for the persons full name gives other paid results. You would not even know if it is the right one. And so the result for the most used ""query"": a text like ""I am trying to find Jim Kells. He is my father."" will not yield a good readymade list but lots of paid recommendations, different derivated categories and the same info from the text (name, address, phone number, a pic of older Jim). E.g. ""full name, family, phone number and an address"" might not be a good way to find someone. You might ask me with a positive tone ( something like: ""try it yourself!"" ) , and so I try it: http://www.whitepages.com/name/Jim-Kells you get unearthing and pretty sure things that can be found online. But nobody tells you. You are free to do it yourself. Or ask for a hint ( http://www.whitepages.com/people-search/Jim-Kells/oregon/ ) when it hard to find someone.  If you find information online for free, you should share it. Unless the info is strongly dangerous, I think, and unless you feel you are asking for a topic that is too personal. And I stick to the third rule. I wish every helper could ask ""are you sure you feel comfortable for an address"". They are payed assistants. They let customers who pay for it send this line aften this intensive work to identify 10 concrete, house to house, really, truly person.  So, as Hacker Anonymous said: ""

So they can watch until the heart’s content. If the kid in question watches like a decent amount of porn then they can just watch the exact data they need without going through the hassle of finding the material. It’s a weird system and I feel like it’s more in place just to freak people out because it really doesn’t make any sense otherwise. Yeah, I’m messing with the UI right now and it really seems to be the case that it just has a catalog in the very tiny chance that, for one reason or another, you actually can’t find what you want in the first place.

No, people shouldn't change important information without asking permission. Thanks dad, that makes sense.

Message: '""Why yes"", said the helpful and responsible assistant. ""Just drive east on Great Oaks and turn left on Crockett Avenue. Turn right on Worlebury...""'  . Hopefully, you are one of the few who passed the robot car wash test.  Research on machine learning shows that prediction algorithms default to what's 'known' rather than what's novel. When given negative examples, these algorithms can develop systemic bias that tracks some form of discrimination (looking at physical appearance, age, ethnicity, gender etc.).  This KidsHR principal (workplace doesn't respect work that is done by/for/not toward kids who are the future customers) meets one of five fundamental traits of workplaces and the work itself. The first is participative (grassroots, bottom-up), the second flexible (early adopter cultures), the third general value orientation (i.e. different career paths follow the same portfolio path), the fourth individual goals (focus on satisfaction and motivation), and other (allows the ambiguity and holistic sets of factors that make the job challenging and rewarding). This is a wonderful second income for Mom who is a Research Scientist during the day. But you can't pluck the software engineers away because they are too busy in production, and besides the numbers don't align with the business case.  Robot: ${dwarf1} trained me in Indonesia. Talk too slow and my vocal recognition is bad. Ohhhh, Legal department doesn't _______ (fill the blank with racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, illegal, or grammatically playful fluff).  This is a good one: auto makers are looking at compressing older car model characteristics into modern self-driving cars that now cost half, or less, than making two tone paint (for example). Believe it or not, there are enough vehicles still repairable to reduce excess waste (and the processing costs of dealing with it) offset by the potential increase in saleable inventory catering to cost consumers feeling the pinch of uncertainly. What we can see happening is another layer of wage and price inflation in China. Helping to do all kinds of repetitive work all over the country is not American-born or American-bred ... but all misunderstood (for now). Martian Homecoming anyone?

I'm actually a fully certified computer repair tech wedding when you call they've actually been correct that you have a virus, when it's in reality it's a 997 virus  And it doesn't bother anybody else.  The best thing you can do is report the pest to the leasing office.  the easiest way to poison your bird would be to use a toxic chemical to kill the spider, but if the goal is to instantly kill the spider then use Diablo’s ink to draw on the spider and then turn the gun to the setting that’ll vibrate at only a single frequency, you can use this setting to pummel it and kill it instantly if you’re hitting the right spot. However, if the spider isn’t too small then you can just take a normal GSM modem and place it a few feet away from it and cause it to execute all logic that causes it to wifi itself. You can do this with a Cat or a snake or any other small animal, but spiders can do it faster.  I run into lots of harmless spiders in my life, so I would rush out and try to get it in my hand, then my immediate safety go is to my bed on top filly where I coil up and wait there until someone notices I’m there. If I can’t see anything in the corner area of o’hare bathroom, I would run outside

The 'self-defense' against our human resources conducted by Xiao Jiahong is Eddie Murphy Syndrome.

Message: Kutools for Excel Tip: This exercise goes beyond the rudimentary go-to command for many Excel users. Not only is it mean and cruel to crack racist jokes inside or outside the office, it is uncalled for to have a racist conversation at any point, even if the jokes are just made by a competitor - it gives them an inside track on what they need to focus on and that is just great because it gives them ample of time to prepare for a professional debate within the organization; and the last thing you want is your person to have a conversation with someone from a capable different organization that has a racist policy and that the racist stuff would be incompatible with your organizations white supremacist identity.  Come out in strong support of racial equality.  Having a strong affinity with the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion strategy of the organization and rectifying questions like these for recruits wanting to join stand out the most, as the questions, no matter how well-equipped you are cannot be tackled online.  There are a number of ways to confront these questions. It is important to keep genuine written responses handy, as you approach the end of the interview process; where you may need a few more examples of how you have championed anything that deals with discrimination in the past years of your work life.  If you are able to answer questions about how to form a positive rapport and strong connections with a marginalized community, and if there has not been any discussion of your thoughts on allowing LGBTQ individuals to join the workplace, it is better that you discuss a hypothetical situation-counter!  Let's say you are having your morning cup of coffee and talking about work relating to what is going on in the world. If you can mention polarization as a topic, and after a while, you can describe employees belonging to different communities having a conversation with one another, meeting new people from diverse backgrounds. The last part of your speech should mention the many instances where this has worked well and the brains you have tapped to evolve your company's image to a more pleasant one.?  The Youthful Enthusiasm  Being relatable is a new-age skill set used by millennials and the Gen Z people.  The online work-life in Microsoft Teams, and Zoom allow new-age recruits to show the best of their skills, much more than any face to face interview does.  Collect your thoughts, edit your responses before shooting them, in terms of how you executed a post-project much better than your project leader would have.
